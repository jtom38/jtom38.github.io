So when it came to getting some of my sites hosted online, well I have had some pitfalls. Hopefully some of the issues I have run into, you can avoid going forward.</p><h2 id=history>History</h2><p>I am always looking for the next free thing when it comes to my projects. This has resulted in me hosting things internally only or not at all. I got my domain so I can start to detach more from the big sites and do things on my own a bit. But now, I had to figure out how to build a site.</p><p>Building the site was not as hard, <a href>hugo</a> did make this site much easier to build. I am not looking for anything complex and with a bunch of javascript overhead so a static website generator was perfect! At first, I was able to get something online at least locally and it looked good. So it was time to deploy it.</p><h2 id=github>Github</h2><p>I start with attempting to deploy on <a href>github.io</a>. This comes packed in with the repository and all I needed to do was make a couple of changes to deploy the site. Got that setup and then the site was available at jtom38.github.io. Well, that&rsquo;s nice and all but I wanted to get it to route to my domain. This is when things started to fall apart.</p><p>Based on the documentation this process should be nothing more than adding a record into my DNS and then setting up the CNAME record. Well, it worked somewhat. One page would work but none of the subpages would load correctly. I would then put the project down for a while as time was limited.</p><p>I started to work on a custom hugo theme <a href=https://github.com/jtom38/hugo-cookbook>cookbook</a> for my new family cookbook. I did learn more about the inner workings of Hugo and that was great! I did get that site running just on <a href>github.io</a> but never made it back to my site (this one).</p><h2 id=digital-ocean>Digital Ocean</h2><p>Later on, I thought about it and figured I needed to take a look at getting a hosted solution for the sites. Attempted Digital Ocean due to having something like 5 free static sites per account. I thought that would be great! I went through the process of getting started and stopped within one night. The problem is I use the go.mod file in my hugo projects. The go.mod file is much better than using a git submodule for hugo.</p><p>The problem is Digital Ocean attempts to detect what your project is based on reviewing the repo. Sure, go for it. When I attempted to tell it that it was a Hugo project, it would never build correctly. I would attempt to manually tell it what the project was and then wanted to give me a monthly bill. No, this is a static website so give me the free stuff!</p><p>Needless to say, this never worked out and it was abandoned.</p><h2 id=azure-static-web-sites>Azure Static Web Sites</h2><p>I am now back home after a trip and I wanted to get these sites all hosted in a location that was not just my home network. I can make a docker image or an Apache server, but I don&rsquo;t have a static IP at home and that was going to be another problem. I do have a solution for the lack of static IP, but more on that in a later post. :)</p><p>At one point in time, I did use an AWS S3 bucket to host a website. It was fine, it worked I am just not an AWS guy. I learned Azure first for work and that&rsquo;s where I stayed. So I got a new Azure subscription setup and I was going to host the site in an Azure Storage Account in a public blob bucket. Then I remembered that Microsoft has a free tier for Azure Static Web Sites. I did some digging and figured, why not try it? The hugo documentation was pushed this way and let me give you my thoughts.</p><p>I am now running this site on the Azure service and my initial impressions of Azure Static Web Sites, are good! I created a new FREE resource and give it access to my repo. Azure/Github loaded a new CI workflow to deploy to the Azure resource and within 5 minutes, the site was online. The theme was loaded and the links looked good. I was happy!</p><p>Getting DNS setup was also very simple. On the left-hand side, go to Custom Domains to get started. Tell it what the domain would be (example: <a href=https://www.yourdomainhere.com>www.yourdomainhere.com</a>) and copy the URL given and create a new DNS record. Once the record has been made, go back to Azure and tell it Ok. It will check the records and enable the traffic.</p><p>Overall this was very painless and I am glad this is another thing off my to-do list. Now back to some of my other projects that I might have been neglecting.</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/azure/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">azure</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/hugo/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">hugo</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/hosting/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">hosting</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://www.jamestombleson.com/>&copy; James Tombleson 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials><a href=https://github.com/jtom38 target=_blank rel=noopener class="github ananke-social-link link-transition stackoverflow link dib z-999 pt3 pt0-l mr1" title="GitHub link" aria-label="follow on GitHub——Opens in a new window"><span class=icon><svg style="enable-background:new 0 0 512 512" viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M256 32C132.3 32 32 134.8 32 261.7c0 101.5 64.2 187.5 153.2 217.9 11.2 2.1 15.3-5 15.3-11.1.0-5.5-.2-19.9-.3-39.1-62.3 13.9-75.5-30.8-75.5-30.8-10.2-26.5-24.9-33.6-24.9-33.6-20.3-14.3 1.5-14 1.5-14 22.5 1.6 34.3 23.7 34.3 23.7 20 35.1 52.4 25 65.2 19.1 2-14.8 7.8-25 14.2-30.7-49.7-5.8-102-25.5-102-113.5.0-25.1 8.7-45.6 23-61.6-2.3-5.8-10-29.2 2.2-60.8.0.0 18.8-6.2 61.6 23.5 17.9-5.1 37-7.6 56.1-7.7 19 .1 38.2 2.6 56.1 7.7 42.8-29.7 61.5-23.5 61.5-23.5 12.2 31.6 4.5 55 2.2 60.8 14.3 16.1 23 36.6 23 61.6.0 88.2-52.4 107.6-102.3 113.3 8 7.1 15.2 21.1 15.2 42.5.0 30.7-.3 55.5-.3 63 0 6.1 4 13.3 15.4 11C415.9 449.1 480 363.1 480 261.7 480 134.8 379.7 32 256 32z"/></svg></span><span class=new-window><svg height="8" style="enable-background:new 0 0 1000 1000" viewBox="0 0 1e3 1e3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M598 128h298v298h-86V274L392 692l-60-60 418-418H598v-86zM810 810V512h86v298c0 46-40 86-86 86H214c-48 0-86-40-86-86V214c0-46 38-86 86-86h298v86H214v596h596z" style="fill-rule:evenodd;clip-rule:evenodd"/></svg></span></a><a href=index.xml target=_blank rel=noopener class="rss ananke-social-link link-transition stackoverflow link dib z-999 pt3 pt0-l mr1" title="RSS link" aria-label="follow on RSS——Opens in a new window"><span class=icon><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><circle cx="6.18" cy="17.82" r="2.18"/><path id="scale" d="M4 4.44v2.83c7.03.0 12.73 5.7 12.73 12.73h2.83c0-8.59-6.97-15.56-15.56-15.56zm0 5.66v2.83c3.9.0 7.07 3.17 7.07 7.07h2.83c0-5.47-4.43-9.9-9.9-9.9z"/></svg></span><span class=new-window><svg height="8" style="enable-background:new 0 0 1000 1000" viewBox="0 0 1e3 1e3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M598 128h298v298h-86V274L392 692l-60-60 418-418H598v-86zM810 810V512h86v298c0 46-40 86-86 86H214c-48 0-86-40-86-86V214c0-46 38-86 86-86h298v86H214v596h596z" style="fill-rule:evenodd;clip-rule:evenodd"/></svg></span></a></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
